This is my portfolio site generated using Next.JS in order to experiement with Tailwind, Framer Motion, and GitPages.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This is also being hosted on GitPages [here](https://zachary-davies.github.io/portfolio/).
